  <!--"name" is a mandatory descriptive name for the talk (it appears in a combobox at the top of the 
  main window)-->

  <!--"section" is an optional identifier referring to the section of the meeting in which the talk is 
  scheduled. It's not used directly by OnlyT but remote control apps may use it-->

  <!--"duration" is mandatory and specified the duration of the talk. The format is hr:mm:ss-->

  <!--"editable" is an optional attribute to determine whether the user can manually modify the item's
  duration  (false by default)-->

  <!--Use the optional "bell" attribute to automatically sound a bell at the expiration of an item's
  duration (false by default)-->

  <!--Use the optional "countup" attribute to specify whether the timer should count up (true) or 
  down (false). If you leave it empty or remove the attribute then the timer will use the value 
  specified in the OnlyT Settings page-->

  <!--Use the optional "persist" attribute to specify that a timer value should remain on-screen after 
  the timer has stopped (useful for a chairman to note the speaker's time)-->

  <!--Use the optional "closing" attribute to specify the duration of the closing phase of an item. At 
  this point, the timer's text colour changes from green to yellow, indicating that the speaker should 
  begin to wind up! Default is 30 seconds. Set to 0 to turn off the feature-->
